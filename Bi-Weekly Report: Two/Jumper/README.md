How to Play Jumper!!!

Goal: Jump over the upcoming obstacles (i.e. snails and flies)

User Input: Press the 'spacebar' to avoid the obstacles

Note: the only key binded to this game is the spacebar. I removed the ability to move left and right due to the layer of complexity. 


Refer back to "Bi-Weekly Report: One" for the file that contains the font. 

However, new images have been uploaded to the file, Graphic Images. Specifically new images to the player file (i.e. player_jump and player_stand)
